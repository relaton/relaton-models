class Citation {
  definition {
    Representation of a citation of a bibliographic item, typically within a document.
  }

  +date: Iso8601DateTime[0..1] {
    definition {
    	Date of the citation, typically date of publication. A combination of the date time elements
    	year, month and day should be specified.
        Specification of month and day are optional.

      NOTE: Specification of month and day are optional.

      NOTE: This date is not intended for disambiguation, since `bibitemid`
      already identifies the source unambiguously; it is added for ease of
      processing, in case author-date citations cannot straightforwardly extract
      the date from the bibliographic source.
    }
  }

  +bibLocalityStack: LocalityStack[0..*] {
    definition {
      Describes the location of the cited information resource within the
      subject of the bibliographic item in a hierarchical manner.

      [example]
      The hierarchical specification "Part IV, Chapter 3, Paragraphs 22-24" is
      represented as a single `bibLocalityStack`, composed of those three
      localities.

      Multiple `bibLocalityStack` elements are interpreted as discontinuous
      references.
    }
  }

  +bibItem: BibliographicItem[0..1] {
    definition {
      Bibliographic item that the citation applies to.

      NOTE: `bibItem` is realised in serialisation as a crossreference to a complete
      `bibItem` record elsewhere in a document.

      A single citation may span multiple bibliographic items.

      [example]
      A contiguous or disjoint range of volumes can be represented with an
      aggregatation of multiple bibliographic items.
